            <h1>What is Celery Kimchi</h1>
            <p>Celery kimchi is a creative and refreshing twist on the classic Korean dish. While traditional kimchi is typically made with napa cabbage, this version uses celery as the main ingredient, offering a unique balance of crunchy texture and bold, spicy flavors. The celery absorbs the tangy, fermented flavors of the kimchi brine, creating a crisp and flavorful dish that’s both familiar and exciting.</p>

            <p>With the same foundational ingredients as traditional kimchi, such as gochugaru (Korean chili flakes), garlic, ginger, and fermented fish sauce, celery kimchi delivers a refreshing, crunchy bite. It’s perfect as a side dish, topping, or even a snack. This version allows you to enjoy the health benefits and complex flavors of kimchi with a lighter, crunchier twist.</p>
            
            <p>Ideal for those looking to explore classic Korean flavors in a fresh way, celery kimchi adds a delightful crunch and bold flavor to a wide variety of dishes, making it a versatile and exciting addition to any culinary repertoire.</p>
