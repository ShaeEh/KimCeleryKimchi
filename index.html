            <h1>What is Celery Kimchi</h1>
            <p>Celery kimchi is a creative and refreshing twist on the classic Korean dish. While traditional kimchi is typically made with napa cabbage, this version uses celery as the main ingredient, offering a unique balance of crunchy texture and bold, spicy flavors. The celery absorbs the tangy, fermented flavors of the kimchi brine, creating a crisp and flavorful dish that’s both familiar and exciting.</p>

            <p>With the same foundational ingredients as traditional kimchi, such as gochugaru (Korean chili flakes), garlic, ginger, and fermented fish sauce, celery kimchi delivers a refreshing, crunchy bite. It’s perfect as a side dish, topping, or even a snack. This version allows you to enjoy the health benefits and complex flavors of kimchi with a lighter, crunchier twist.</p>
            
            <p>Ideal for those looking to explore classic Korean flavors in a fresh way, celery kimchi adds a delightful crunch and bold flavor to a wide variety of dishes, making it a versatile and exciting addition to any culinary repertoire.</p>

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hello! I’m Chef Kim Jiho Lee, a proud Harvard Culinary Arts graduate with a passion for experimenting with flavors from around the world. Throughout my culinary journey, I’ve explored countless ingredients and combinations, but one pairing stands out above the rest: kimchi celery.</p>

          <p>The bold, spicy kick of kimchi combined with the fresh, crisp crunch of celery is a unique flavor combination that I’ve come to love. After years of experimenting with these two ingredients, I discovered how they complement each other in unexpected ways, creating a perfect balance of heat and refreshment.</p>

          <p>My goal is to showcase the versatility of kimchi celery, blending Korean tradition with modern culinary techniques. Through my recipes, I hope to inspire others to explore this unique and exciting combination in their own kitchens. </p>

          <p>If you’re excited to try new flavors and dive into creative cooking, I’m so glad you’ve joined me. Let’s discover, experiment, and savor the bold and refreshing taste of kimchi celery together!</p>
